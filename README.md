# Module-8-Journal

This project is written in C++, calls functions written in Python, and reads/manipulates data from a txt file. It reads all items written in the txt file using Python and displays information on either all items or any one specific item, or writes to another .dat file and displays that data as a histogram.

I feel that I wrote this code efficiently and made good use of Python. I think I demonstrated a decent understanding of both languages.

As the C++ functions used to call functions from Python were provided to me, I did not know how to manipulate them or create new ones to call functions with different parameter or return types. Learning hwo to write these complex functions would've allowed me to better customize my code.

I found the most challenging aspect to be initally moving the items from the txt file to a dictionary in Python. I was having a hard time finding out why every item was spacing strangely. Eventually, I relaized that the issue was simply that I was inputting a newline from the source file, so I just stripped it in the loop.

The ability to use two languages in combination with each other will likely prove to be very useful in other projects down the line. When working with older systems, for example. The ability to create functions in newer languages and use them in the older system will be very useful.

I used inline comments, defined my functions outside of main, and spaced/organized my code efficiently to maintain readability and adaptability.
